        <h1>Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Target Shooter Clicker! Here's how to play...
        <br><br>
        1. Getting Your First Weapon: It's simple. Click on "Earn Points" to activate your touch gun to earn points. You may upgrade your touch gun to increase the amount of points it gives per click. After earning 10 points, you can finally buy the Pistol to start your shooting-range tycoon! Remember that you can purchase more weapons once you rack up enough points.
        <br><br>
        2. Weapon Stats: Each weapon has its own and unique stats. Some weapons have basic stats. Some weapons have unique stats, such as the Shotgun being able to pelt more projectiles at the target range. "Firerate" improves the weapon's firing speed, increasing their overall PPS (Points Per Second) and gets gradually expensive overtime, but also has a maximum level cap to prevent making weapons shoot hypersonically. "Potency" improves the weapon's overall power, increasing the amount of points it gets from shooting a target, additively based on the weapon's current Points Per Shot.
        <br><br>
        3. Big Upgrades: On the "Upgrades" tab, you'll find plenty of improvements for your weapons. Improving your weapons increases their Points Per Shot, their firerate and their special stats. They do come with such a hefty cost but only one-time purchases so definitely worth getting.
        <br><br>
        4. Settings: If you feel like turning off the gunshots, changing your numberformat or saving your game data, it's possible to configure them through the "Settings" tab.
		<br><br>
        5. Battle: Upon reaching there, there's four subtabs: Battle, Stats, Loadout and Encyclopaedia. Battle is for battling against a horde of monsters in an automatic RPG system, but you'll need at least one weapon equipped in your loadout to play. Stats is for checking all the current weapon stats in battle, as well as being able to upgrade some of their stats, such as HP. Loadout is for assigning purchased weapons in your battle loadout, so you can battle against waves of monsters. And finally the Encyclopaedia allows you to check what enemies you've encountered, such as viewing their stats.
		<br><br>
        6. Prestige: If you're rich enough, then it's finally time to Prestige your progress! When prestiging your progress will be soft-reset, however you'll keep your earned achievements, your total statistics and your multiplier. Your multiplier doubles for every prestige level invested into, the more rich, the more merrier!
        <br><br>
        7. You're Ready To Go!: Keep upgrading your weapons, installing big improvements on them and become the Ultimate Shooting Range Master!</p>

        <h1>Changelog</h1>
		<h3>12th June 2024:</h3>
		<h5>Update 1.7:</h5>
        <p>
        - Introducing: Battle Equipment! Give your weapons some extra measures by assigning some nice and juicy equipment onto them to make them stronger! Each weapon slot has three equipment slots, albeit you can unlock two extra slots by spending some points for each loadout slot.
		<br>
        -- Monsters have an assigned chance to drop equipment, and bosses are guaranteed to drop one when defeated. However higher waves will increase the drop rates significantly.
		<br>
        -- There's five different stat boosts from our equipments: HP, Damage, Walking Speed, Attack Rate and Armour. So choose what's best equipped for each weapon class.
		<br>
        - 12th branch of non-hp big upgrades added for all weapons.
		<br>
        - 4th branch of hp big upgrades (Fortified Body) added for all weapons.
		<br>
        - Added 6 new achievements (Monster Slayer, Boss Slayer, Survivor, Armed Tank, Tera Shot, Medallist)
		<br>
        - Added upgrade descriptions for each big upgrade
		<br>
        - Update adjustments:
		<br>
        -- We've heard your feedback about how flawed TSC is currently is - so we'll be doing some significant fixes and changes to help keep things spick and span.
		<br>
        -- Client update:
		<br>
        --- Weapons' and enemies' stats initialized should properly accurate through in-game updates.
		<br>
        -- Balance changes:
		<br>
        --- The points achievements were adjusted to use your lifetime points for achievement tracking. Don't worry - it'll be the same but more consistent!
		<br>
        --- Weapons past Shotgun now have tweaked damage values from their "Points Per Shot" stat. However potency upgrades still upgrades damage by 50% reduced effectiveness from "Points Per Shot".
		<br>
		--- Double Barrel: Points Per Shot &amp Damage increased from 6,000 -> 9,000 per shot!
		<br>
		--- Uzi: Points Per Shot &amp Damage increased from 4,500 -> 6,000 per shot!
		<br>
		--- Hunting Rifle: Points Per Shot &amp Damage increased from 250,000 -> 300,000 per shot!
		<br>
		--- Musket: Points Per Shot &amp Damage increased from 750,000 -> 1,333,000 per shot!
		<br>
        -- Bug fixes:
		<br>
        --- Fixed a bug in Battle mode where projectile collisions were inconsistent especially against faster enemies. Not only that this bugfix will also resolve a bug where weapons are unable to hit enemies that were very close due to the accuracy/collision changes.
		<br>
        --- Fixed an issue where Prestige was giving too much points from enemy defeats
		<br>
        --- Fixed a bug where some hp upgrade costs weren't properly saved
		<br>
        --- Tabs can no longer be switched while battle is ongoing. This is to prevent cheesing from many scenarios.
		</p>
		<h3>3rd June 2024:</h3>
		<h5>Update 1.6.2:</h5>
        <p>
        - Fixed an issue where prestige and encountered enemies weren't properly saved through local storage
		<br>
        - Fixed an issue where lifetime points won't statistically count through killing enemies
		</p>
		<h3>2nd June 2024:</h3>
		<h5>Update 1.6.1:</h5>
        <p>
        - We've updated our main UI, to make it a lot more user-friendly
		<br>
        -- The weapons and targets no longer have ASCII art assets sadly, so we've ended up using the more modern designs!
		<br>

		</p>
		<h3>1st June 2024:</h3>
		<h5>Update 1.6:</h5>
        <p>
        - Added a new enemy: Armoured. Armoured enemies have slightly lower hitpoints and damage output than Tanks, but they can resist 50% less damage from all bullets. However, tracers shot from snipers and rockets fired from rocket launchers will still deal the full damage potential to them.
		<br>
        -- They'll appear once you hit wave 11 and above.
		<br>
		- 11th branch of big upgrades added for all weapons, specifically for increasing their points per shot and damage for the endgame.
		<br>
		- 3rd branch of HP big upgrades has been added for all weapons (Thicker Body), specifically to retain consistency throughout Battle mode.
		<br>
		- 3 new touch gun big upgrades added (Healthy Fingers, Quadrillion Fingers, Tap Expert).
		<br>
        - Added an "Encyclopaedia" subtab in battle, to view the current discovered enemies and their stats
		<br>
        - Added 2 new stats: Total Touch Gun Clicks and Total Enemies Killed.
		<br>
        - Updated the tutorial
		<br>
        - Balance adjustments:
        <br>
        -- Battle mode:
		<br>
		--- All enemies now drop twice as much points from being defeated.
		<br>
		--- Weapons with "Multi-Fire" and "Accuracy" stats should properly work and take into account in battle.
		<br>
		--- Fixed a bug where starting a wave and then saved/loaded game progress would unintentionally increase the wave count without beating the former wave
		<br>
		--- Boss: Damage and HP both reduced by 25%. This is to make the early waves more easier and applicable.
		<br>
		--- Tank: Hit speed increased by 25% (1000ms -> 1250ms). Tanks were still too tough to deal with!
		<br>
		-- Big Upgrades:
		<br>
		--- HP: Moved "Armoured Body" into the 4th upgrade row (from 5th) but is a lot cheaper now! The first HP upgrade "More Resistant" was also made cheaper.
		<br>
		--- SMG: Further reduced big upgrade costs, starting from the big upgrade "Strong Hold".
		<br>
		--- Shotgun: Further reduced big upgrade costs, starting from the big upgrade "Powerful Burst".
		<br>
		--- Sniper Rifle: Further reduced big upgrade costs, starting from the big upgrade "Deadly Precision".
		<br>
		--- AK-47: Further reduced big upgrade costs, starting from the big upgrade "Heat-tipped Bullets".
		<br>
		--- Rocket Launcher: Further reduced big upgrade costs, starting from the big upgrade "Potent Rockets".
		<br>
		-- Prestige:
		<br>
		--- Prestiging now also increases the maximum hp of all weapons based on the current multiplier (also multiplies the hp stat upgrades!)

		<br>
		- Fixed touch gun upgrades related to every potency level count misbehaving in values

        -- Reduced many touch gun big upgrade costs
		<br>
		-- Rocket Launcher: Increased points per shot and damage from 1,250/625 to 1,750/875!
		</p>
		<h5>Update 1.5.1:</h5>
        <p>
        - Target Shooter Clicker is now available on itch.io and Kongregate!
        <br>

		<br>

		<br>
        --- Additionally, we've beefed up the HP stats for the more expensive weapons!
